    <h2>VirtualEye - LifeGuard for Swimming
        Pools to Detect Active Drowning
        </h2>
    <p>Swimming is one of the finest exercises which is a good 
        practice for all age group people which regulates our 
        body in many ways and keeps us healthy and fit. But due 
        to the fear of  drowning(which leads to death sometimes)
         most of the people are avoiding swimming.  So this condition has
          to be turned down
         .Children under six of their age are found to be suffering the highest 
         drowning mortality rates worldwide. Such kinds of deaths account for 
         the third cause of unplanned death globally, with about 1.2 million 
         cases yearly. To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is 
         to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.
